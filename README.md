# Luminate-Online-Calendar-Event-API

The Calendar Event API allows you to retrieve Event information from Luminate Online and re-display the Event details in a third-party web site or web-based application. 

This code defines the variables returned from the JSON file and outputs the data into HTML. 

This code also uses moment.js to convert the timestamp to human-readable format.
